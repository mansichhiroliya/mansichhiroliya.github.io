While you can buy Tips on this Site, the purchase price is only for the opinion presented in the Tip, and does not depend on the odds or actual outcome of the sporting event. We do not pay out any winnings and take no risk or position on the results of the event. It is your sole responsibility to act on the Tips, and any wins or losses that you may obtain from using such Tips to bet with independent gaming sites is for your sole account. We have no affiliation with any gaming site or any gambling operator.</p>

We hope that you will be with us for a long time. But we do reserve the right, based on our reasonable discretion, to determine whether or not your use of Site complies with these Terms. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Site or any services for any reason, without notice at any time. We can suspend or terminate your account at any time for any reason (acting reasonably of course), including but not limited to suspicion of fraudulent activity, or non-compliance with these Terms. If we do decide to permanently terminate your account you must not apply for a new account as unfortunately you will no longer be welcome on our Site. Cancellation. You can cancel your subscription at any time by emailing us at support@BETACCUMULATORTIPS.net. However, cancellation shall not result in refunds for any payments already made. Once your account is cancelled, we may permanently delete all of your content and personal data from the Site.</p>
